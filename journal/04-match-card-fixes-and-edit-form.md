# Journal Entry 04: Match Card Fixes and Edit Form Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-27

## Summary

This entry covers several fixes and feature implementations related to the match display and simulation functionality:

1.  **Score Display Correction:** Addressed an issue in `MatchCard.tsx` where scores for completed matches were incorrectly assigned. The logic now correctly uses the `first_batting_team` data from `CompletedMatch` to assign `innings1_summary` and `innings2_summary` to the respective home and away teams.
2.  **TBD Match Filtering:** Updated `ScenarioTree.tsx` to filter out matches where either the home or away team has the code 'TBD'. These matches, identified as playoff fixtures, are now excluded from the main league stage timeline view.
3.  **Edit Details Type Definition:** Defined the structure for `ScenarioInput.editDetails` within `src/types.ts` based on the specifications provided in `TREE_DESIGN.md`. This structure includes fields for `teamChoice`, `outcome`, `marginValue`, `marginUnit`, `remainingValue`, and `remainingUnit`.
4.  **Edit Form Implementation:** Implemented the match result simulation form within the `MatchCard.tsx` component. The placeholder edit section was replaced with the actual form inputs as specified in `TREE_DESIGN.md`. This allows users to click on a match's result card and input simulation details. The `handleSave` and `generateResultSummary` functions were updated accordingly.

## Files Modified

-   `ipl-simulator/src/components/MatchCard.tsx`: Corrected score display logic, implemented edit form UI and state handling.
-   `ipl-simulator/src/components/ScenarioTree.tsx`: Added filtering to exclude 'TBD' matches from the league stage rendering.
-   `ipl-simulator/src/types.ts`: Defined the `ScenarioInput.editDetails` interface.
-   `ipl-simulator/journal/04-match-card-fixes-and-edit-form.md`: This journal entry.

## Next Steps

-   Further refinement of the playoff tree rendering logic in `ScenarioTree.tsx`.
-   Potentially implement score generation based on simulation input (`generatePlausibleScores` placeholder).
-   Review and potentially refactor `AppState` and `ScenarioInput` based on the integrated data types.
