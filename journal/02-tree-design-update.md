# Journal Entry 02: Tree Design Implementation and Refinement

**Date:** 2025-04-27

**Objective:** Update the scenario tree visualization based on the specifications in `TREE_DESIGN.md` and user feedback, focusing on layout, interactivity, and data representation.

**Changes Implemented:**

1.  **Analyzed Requirements:** Reviewed `TREE_DESIGN.md` and the provided reference image to understand the desired structure (Playoff Tree / Separator / Normal Tree) and the `MatchCard` component's display/edit states.
2.  **Type Definitions (`types.ts`):**
    *   Modified `ScenarioInput` to include an `editDetails` object, capturing the detailed fields required for the simulation edit form (team choice, outcome, margin, remaining units, etc.).
    *   Added an optional `resultSummary` field to both `MatchResult` and `ScenarioInput` to store the generated text summary for display.
3.  **Match Card Refactor (`MatchCard.tsx`):**
    *   **Layout:** Rebuilt the component structure to match the specified layout: Team A Logo -> Team A Score -> Result Card -> Team B Score -> Team B Logo.
    *   **Result Card States:**
        *   Implemented a display state showing a generated summary string.
        *   Implemented an edit state (activated on click) containing the form with dropdowns and text inputs as per `TREE_DESIGN.md`.
    *   **Interactivity:**
        *   Enabled clicking on the result card area to toggle edit mode for *all* match statuses (Scheduled, Completed, Simulated).
        *   Implemented `handleSave` to update the `userScenario` context with the detailed `editDetails` and the generated `resultSummary`. Ensured the card correctly reverts to the display state after saving.
        *   Implemented `handleCancel` to discard changes and revert to the display state.
    *   **Data Display:**
        *   Created a unified `generateResultSummary` helper function to create the display string from either actual `MatchResult` data or simulated `editDetails`. This fixed the "Result unavailable" issue for completed matches.
        *   Displayed actual scores (`team1Score`, `team2Score`) if available in `match.result`.
    *   **Styling:** Adjusted spacing and layout for better presentation, including fixed widths for score areas.
4.  **Scenario Tree Refactor (`ScenarioTree.tsx`):**
    *   **Structure:** Divided the component into three sections: Playoffs (currently a placeholder), a visual Separator, and League Matches.
    *   **Sorting:** Updated the sorting for the League Matches section to be reverse chronological (latest matches appear at the top), as per user feedback.
    *   **Visuals:** Added basic indentation and connecting lines using CSS to give a rudimentary tree-like appearance to the league match list. Noted that a more complex, dynamic tree (especially for playoffs) would require SVG or a dedicated library.
5.  **Score Generation (Placeholder):** Added a placeholder function `generatePlausibleScores` in `MatchCard.tsx` but noted that the complex logic for generating realistic scores based on simulation input is not yet implemented.

**Outcome:**

The Scenario Tree now reflects the requested structure and sorting. The `MatchCard` component provides the detailed layout, displays results correctly for all states, and allows users to input detailed simulations for any match, updating the display accordingly upon saving. The core requirements from `TREE_DESIGN.md` regarding the card's functionality are met, pending the advanced score generation and playoff bracket rendering.
